Input: 2 Strings
    String 1: 
    String 2: 

Process: Determine longest common substring
    1)	Assign placement values to all letters in String 1 and String 2. 
    2)	Create a temporary sub-string holder to catch matching case values. 
    3)	From left to right, evaluate placement value ‘1’ in both strings. 
        a.	If the values match, add the letter to the temporary sub-string.
        b.	If the values do not match, do not add the letter to the temporary sub-string.  
    4)	Evaluate the next placement value of both strings. 
        a.	If the value of the position matches in both strings, add the letter to the temporary substring. 
        b.	If the value of the next position does not match: 
            i.	Create a new temporary substring holder called Substring Holder +1
            ii.	Move values of the temporary substring to the new substring holder created in Step 4bi.
    5)	Repeat Step 4 until all placement values have been evaluated. 
    6)	Consider all Substring Holders that were created in Step 4bi.
        a.	Count the number of values in each holder. 
        b.	The holder with the largest number of substring values should return the list of values as Output.
        c.	If the substring holders only has ‘1’ or equal values, return a phrase that displays that there is no largest substring. 

Output: Result of Step 6b or 6c
