assignment 6 instructions

This assignment asks you to write a collection of little functions that all operate on a class of array of 
integers.

The main function for testing is given below. Use the main from below. Do not make changes to the 
main except for substituting first name with your first name. 

Implement a class called arrIntFirstName, 
    1. Class has only one private variable in the class which is an array of ints, called arr. 

    2. Implement a constructor that takes the length as argument and create the array arr using new 
    of that length, but does not fill it.  (See 2, below, for how to fill it.) 

    3. Implement a second constructor that takes an array of ints as an argument and uses it to 
    initialize the arr of the class (kind of like a setter). The kind of copying to use here is called a 
    “shallow copy”. 

    4. Create a function called arrDisplayFirstName () that prints the array to the console in a form that 
    looks exactly like the literal strings used below for initialization of test arrays in main. The literal 
    starts with a “{“, then lists the numbers separated by commas but no spaces, and ending with 
    “}”. The output must even work if the length of the array is 0 (“{}”) or 1 (no commas).  In the 
    arrInt class, only the displayArrFirstName () method should include calls to sysout.  

    5. Create a function called arrTotFirstName that returns the total of the values in the array. 

    6. Create a function called arrMaxFirstName that returns the maximum value in the array. 

    7. Create a function called arrayMinFirstName that returns the minimum value in the array. 

        a. When looking for min or max, compare each new value to the min or max value that you 
        have seen so far. Do not initialize that value to an arbitrary extreme (like 0). Observe 
        that when you check the first value of the array, that value should become the min or 
        max you have seen so far, since you haven’t seen anything else. Assuming that you are 
        using a variable called minSeen, the correct solution is to initialize minSeen to the first 
        value right away, before starting the loop. That way you don’t have to know anything 
        about the range of possible values (which could be all negative, making 0 a bad choice 
        for the initial value.) 

        b. If the Array is empty, The arrayMin and arrayMax methods should just return 0. 

    8.  Create a function called arrRangeFirstName that returns the range of the values in the array. In 
    math, the range is the magnitude of the difference between the minimum and maximum 
    (inclusive). You compute it by subtracting the minimum from the maximum.  You already have 
    methods that return the min and max. Use them and do not include any loops in this method.

    9. Create a function called arrAverageFirstName () that returns the average value in the array. Even 
    though the array contains ints, return the average as a double. Note that you have a method for 
    the sum, and you can get the length by using the array property of the array itself. So this 
    method only has to do a divide. Test that you can get a result that includes a fractional part (not 
    just whole numbers).  

        a. In the average and range functions, use the arrTotFirstName, arrMinFirstName, and 
        arrMaxFirstName functions to compute those parts, rather than repeating the work of 
        computing the sum, or looking for min and max.

    10. Create a function called arrClipFirstName that takes an integer value as an argument and 
    changes any value in the array that is higher than the specified clip value to be the same as the 
    clip value. This function could also be called “haircut”, in that it takes values that are too high, 
    and cuts them down to the allowable height. (Think of a scissor going through your hair and 
    trimming the ones that are too long.) If the array is {2, 4, 6, 7, 3}, after arrClipFirstName (5) it 
    should be {2, 4, 5, 5, 3}. 

        a. When calling the arrClipFirstName () function from main(), we call the 
        arrDisplayFirstName() function before and after as shown below to show as shown the 
        effect of clipping.  Do not print values inside the clip method. 

    11. Create a function called arrfindCountFirstName that takes an integer value as an argument and 
    returns the count of the integer value in the array. If the array is {2, 4, 4, 4, 3}, 
    arrfindCountFirstName (4)  should return the count as 3 as there are three 4s in the array. 


When you are finished in this case submit the whole zipped package with the whole project instead of 
the files. Make sure that you use the default package. Please do not use java.util.Array for any of the 
functions

Here is the main given below. Create an AILNTest Class when LN is your last name and include the 
following two methods in there. Please do not change the main or the method names included in the 
testDataBuffer method except for putting your firstname in.
